Marisa Young Portfolio:

Introduction: An introduction to one of my first major projects that shows off a few of my technical skills that I have learned throughout my time at Learn Academy's software development bootcamp.

Technologies: CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap

Launch: I am continuing to add more details to my portfolio and will add more projects as I gain more experience. My portoflio is still a work in progress.
